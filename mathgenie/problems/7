<h2>Problem Statement 7</h2><h3 align="center">Type : Normal</h3>
<br><br>
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
<br><br>
9 = 7 + 2x(1^2)<br>
15 = 7 + 2x(2^2)<br>
21 = 3 + 2x(3^2)<br>
25 = 7 + 2x(3^2)<br>
27 = 19 + 2x(2^2)<br>
33 = 31 + 2x(1^2)<br>
<br>
It turns out that the conjecture was false.
<br><br>
What is the second smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
